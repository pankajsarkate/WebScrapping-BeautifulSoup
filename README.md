# 🕸️ Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup & Selenium

This project demonstrates **dynamic web scraping** using Python, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium.  
For **educational purposes only**, I scraped data from **AmbitionBox** (only the first 10 pages) to collect company details such as:

- ✅ Company name  
- ⭐ Rating  
- 📝 Reviews  
- 🏢 Company type  
- 📍 Headquarters  

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational use only**.  
I fetched only the first 10 pages. If there is any objection regarding this data usage, I will remove this project without hesitation.

## ✨ Features
- Scrapes dynamic pages using **Selenium** (headless Chrome).  
- Extracts and parses HTML using **BeautifulSoup**.  
- Cleans and organizes the data with **pandas**.  
- Stores results in a structured **DataFrame / CSV file**.  
- Built and tested in **Jupyter Notebook**.

✨ This version is **short, polished, and Jupyter-friendly** — no Streamlit included.  

Do you also want me to write a **`requirements.txt`** file for you so others can `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running your notebook?
